This player has a bold vision.

2
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.800
It’s built to give you full control over your media.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.450
Some say you need multiple tools for video,
but DALPlayer proves them wrong.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.800
You’re lucky—you’ve found the last player you'll ever need.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.300
Thank you.

6
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
So...

7
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.800
What brings you to
the world of DALPlayer?

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.500
I'm searching for simplicity.

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.200
And the power to customize, to make it my own.

10
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.000
You’ve found it.

11
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.750
A versatile tool for any creator.

12
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.870

plugin-first, and ready to grow with you.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.500
